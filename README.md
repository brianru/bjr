This is my personal website.

Eventually this will be a fairly substantial application for collecting, visualizing and maintaining personal data from a variety of sources.

But really it's a place for me to experiment with cool stuff, including:
- clojure
- datalog (bacwn -> datomic when I figure out how to set things up)
- ring
- d3
- clojurescript
- om
